## 4. Technologies installed for this project

This is a React application and the framework was installed with Vite. I have also used Zustand for the global store which is imported into the usePodcastStore.jsx. To assist with navigation I have used React Router, the Routes are set up in my App.jsx file, which maps out the entire app. THis is also where were wrap the pages in the AudioContext so they can communicate with the AudioContext.jsx.

## 5. 3rd person components and icons used.

    - As mentioned the ShowCarousel is from npm React-Multi-Carousel
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-multi-carousel

    - The site logo that I use is a png from pngtree.com and I used favicon.io to convert the png so that it could also be used in the browser tab.

    - The loading progress icon I used is from Material UI and is imported into the pages that need it. https://mui.com/material-ui/react-progress/

    - I have icons like the star and play button which I got from React Icons https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
